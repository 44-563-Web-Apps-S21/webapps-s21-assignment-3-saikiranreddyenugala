    <h1>Black Vulture</h1>
    <h4>Superpowers of black Vulture</h4>
    <p>
        Vultures are rarest of their category. They attack from heights. They do not hide around and always in search of
        food.They have a sharp eyesight and can find small insects on ground. So it makes other beings so vunerable to
        attack by vultures. The black vulture has exceptional attacking skills. They sometimes can scavenge on big
        mammals like cow and buffalo.They have strong claws and legs and wings are so powerful that they can lift thier
        prey which 10 times greater than thier weight.

    <h4>Lair of Black Vulture</h4>
    <p>
        Black Vultures live year-round in forested and open areas of the eastern and southern United States south to
        South America. They have expanded their range northward in the last several decades and are now seen regularly
        as far north as New England. Most abundant at low elevations, they breed in dense woodlands but usually forage
        in open habitats and along roads.

        Some live in semirural suburbs. Black Vultures roost in undisturbed stands of
        tall trees, including sycamores, pines, hickories, oaks, junipers, and bald cypress, as well as structures like
        electrical pylons. Roost sites are often close to water and next to obstructions that generate updrafts of air,
        to help the flock take flight in the early morning.
