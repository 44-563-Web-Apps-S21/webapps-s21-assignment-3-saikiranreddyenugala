    <h1>Introduction to UNIX Shell</h1>
    <blockquote>
        In Unix, the shell is a program that interprets commands and acts as an intermediary between the user and the
        inner workings of the operating system. A shell hides the details of the underlying operating system and manages
        the technical details of the operating system kernel interface, which is the lowest-level, or "inner-most"
        component of most operating systems.
